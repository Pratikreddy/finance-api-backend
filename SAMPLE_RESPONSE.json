      "answer": "# RSI Strategy Implementation\n\n## Overview\n\nThis strategy uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify oversold and overbought conditions in the market. It is designed to buy when RSI drops below 30 and sell when RSI rises above 70, with built-in risk management.\n\n---\n\n## Market Conditions\n\n- **Best for**: Trending or range-bound markets with clear oscillations.\n- **Avoid**: Highly volatile or unpredictable markets where RSI signals may fail.\n\n---\n\n## Entry and Exit Rules\n\n- **Buy Signal**: RSI crosses below 30 (oversold condition).\n- **Sell Signal**: RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition).\n- **Stop Loss**: 2% below entry price.\n- **Take Profit**: 4% above entry price.\n\n---\n\n## PineScript Code\n\n```pinescript\n//@version=5\nstrategy(\"RSI Strategy\", overlay=true)\n\n// Input parameters\nrsiLength = input.int(14, title=\"RSI Length\")\nstopLossPercent = input.float(2, title=\"Stop Loss (%)\") / 100\ntakeProfitPercent = input.float(4, title=\"Take Profit (%)\") / 100\n\n// RSI calculation\nrsi = ta.rsi(close, rsiLength)\n\n// Buy and sell conditions\nbuyCondition = ta.crossover(rsi, 30)\nsellCondition = ta.crossunder(rsi, 70)\n\n// Entry logic\nif (buyCondition)\n    strategy.entry(\"Long\", strategy.long)\n\nif (sellCondition)\n    strategy.close(\"Long\")\n\n// Risk management\nif (strategy.position_size > 0)\n    strategy.exit(\"Exit\", \"Long\", \n        stop=strategy.position_avg_price * (1 - stopLossPercent), \n        limit=strategy.position_avg_price * (1 + takeProfitPercent))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Parameters\n\n| Parameter         | Value |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| RSI Length        | 14    |\n| Stop Loss         | 2%    |\n| Take Profit       | 4%    |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Usage Tips\n\n1. **Timeframe**: Works best on 1-hour or 4-hour charts.\n2. **Adjustments**: You can tweak the RSI levels (e.g., 25/75) for different market conditions.\n3. **Risk Management**: Always test the strategy on historical data before live trading.\n4. **Combine Indicators**: Pair with volume analysis or trend indicators for confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Risk Warnings\n\n> This strategy may generate false signals in choppy markets. Always use proper position sizing and avoid over-leveraging.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Copy the PineScript code into TradingView.\n2. Apply the script to your desired chart.\n3. Adjust the parameters as needed.\n4. Backtest the strategy to evaluate its performance.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Representation\n\nThe script will plot buy and sell signals directly on the chart based on RSI levels. You can monitor the stop loss and take profit levels dynamically.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis RSI strategy is simple yet effective for identifying oversold and overbought conditions. It includes robust risk management to protect your capital and maximize gains.",
